<p>Regression is a tool for assessing the relationship between an <strong>outcome variable</strong>, <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span>, and a set of <strong>covariates</strong>, <span class="math inline">\(\X_i\)</span>. In particular, these tools show how the conditional mean of <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> varies as a function <span class="math inline">\(\X_i\)</span>. For example, we may want to know how wait voting poll wait times vary as a function of some socioeconomic features of the precinct, like income and racial composition. We usually accomplish this task by estimating the <strong>regression function</strong> or <strong>conditional expectation function</strong> (CEF) of the outcome given the covariates, <span class="math display">\[
\mu(\bfx) = \E[Y_i \mid \X_i = \bfx].
\]</span> Why are estimation and inference for this regression function special? Why can’t we just use the approaches we have seen for the mean, variance, covariance, and so on? The fundamental problem with the CEF is that there may be many, many values <span class="math inline">\(\bfx\)</span> that can occur and many different conditional expectations that we will need to estimate. If any variable in <span class="math inline">\(\X_i\)</span> is continuous, we must estimate an infinite number of possible values of <span class="math inline">\(\bfx\)</span>. Because it worsens as we add covariates to <span class="math inline">\(\X_i\)</span>, we refer to this problem as the <strong>curse of dimensionality</strong>. How can we resolve this with our measly finite data?</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will explore two ways of “solving” the curse of dimensionality: assuming it away and changing the quantity of interest to something easier to estimate.</p>
<p>Regression is so ubiquitous in many scientific fields that it has a lot of acquired notational baggage. In particular, the labels of the <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\X_i\)</span> varies greatly:</p>
<ul>
<li>The outcome can also be called: the response variable, the dependent variable, the labels (in machine learning), the left-hand side variable, or the regressand.</li>
<li>The covariates are also called: the explanatory variables, the independent variables, the predictors, the regressors, inputs, or features.</li>
</ul>
<section id="why-do-we-need-models" class="level2" data-number="5.1">
<h2 data-number="5.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-do-we-need-models"><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Why do we need models?</h2>
<p>At first glance, the connection between the CEF and parametric models might be hazy. For example, imagine we are interested in estimating the average poll wait times (<span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span>) for Black voters (<span class="math inline">\(X_i = 1\)</span>) versus non-Black voters (<span class="math inline">\(X_i=0\)</span>). In that case, there are two parameters to estimate, <span class="math display">\[
\mu(1) = \E[Y_i \mid X_i = 1] \quad \text{and}\quad \mu(0) = \E[Y_i \mid X_i = 0],
\]</span> which we could estimate by using the plug-in estimators that replace the population averages with their sample counterparts, <span class="math display">\[
\widehat{\mu}(1) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_{i}\mathbb{1}(X_{i} = 1)}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\mathbb{1}(X_{i} = 1)} \qquad \widehat{\mu}(0) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_{i}\mathbb{1}(X_{i} = 0)}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\mathbb{1}(X_{i} = 0)}.
\]</span> These are just the sample averages of the wait times for Black and non-Black voters, respectively. And because the race variable here is discrete, we are simply estimating sample means within subpopulations defined by race. The same logic would apply if we had <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> racial categories: we would have <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> conditional expectations to estimate and <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> (conditional) sample means.</p>
<p>Now imagine that we want to know how the average poll wait time varies as a function of income so that <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span> is (essentially) continuous. Now we have a different conditional expectation for every possible dollar amount from 0 to Bill Gates’s income. Imagine we pick a particular income, $42,238, and so we are interested in the conditional expectation <span class="math inline">\(\mu(42,238)= \E[Y_{i}\mid X_{i} = 42,238]\)</span>. We could use the same plug-in estimator in the discrete case, <span class="math display">\[
\widehat{\mu}(42,238) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_{i}\mathbb{1}(X_{i} = 42,238)}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\mathbb{1}(X_{i} = 42,238)}.
\]</span> What is the problem with this estimator? In all likelihood, no units in any particular dataset have that exact income, meaning this estimator is undefined (we would be dividing by zero).</p>
<p>One solution to this problem is to use <strong>subclassification</strong>, turn the continuous variable into a discrete one, and proceed with the discrete approach above. We might group incomes into $25,000 bins and then calculate the average wait times of anyone between, say, $25,000 and $50,000 income. When we make this estimator switch for practical purposes, we need to connect it back to the DGP of interest. We could <strong>assume</strong> that the CEF of interest only depends on these binned means, which would mean we have:<br>
<span class="math display">\[
\mu(x) =
\begin{cases}
  \E[Y_{i} \mid 0 \leq X_{i} &lt; 25,000]  &amp;\text{if }  0 \leq x &lt; 25,000 \\
  \E[Y_{i} \mid 25,000 \leq X_{i} &lt; 50,000]  &amp;\text{if }  25,000 \leq x &lt; 50,000\\
  \E[Y_{i} \mid 50,000 \leq X_{i} &lt; 100,000]  &amp;\text{if }  50,000 \leq x &lt; 100,000\\
  \vdots \\
  \E[Y_{i} \mid 200,000 \leq X_{i}]  &amp;\text{if }  200,000 \leq x\\
\end{cases}
\]</span> This approach assumes, perhaps incorrectly, that the average wait time does not vary within the bins. <a href="#fig-cef-binned">Figure&nbsp;<span>5.1</span></a> shows a hypothetical joint distribution between income and wait times with the true CEF, <span class="math inline">\(\mu(x)\)</span> shown in red. The figure also shows the bins created by subclassification and the implied CEF if we assume bin-constant means in blue. We can see that blue function approximates the true CEF but deviates from it close to the bin edges. The trade-off is that once we make the assumption, we only have to estimate one mean for every bin rather than an infinite number of means for each possible income.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Similarly, we could <strong>assume</strong> that the CEF follows a simple functional form like a line, <span class="math display">\[
\mu(x) = \E[Y_{i}\mid X_{i} = x] = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} x.
\]</span> This assumption reduces our infinite number of unknowns (the conditional mean at every possible income) to just two unknowns: the slope and intercept. As we will see, we can use the standard ordinary least squares to estimate these parameters. Notice again that if the true CEF is nonlinear, this assumption is incorrect, and any estimate based on this assumption might be biased or even inconsistent.</p>
<p>We call the binning and linear assumptions on <span class="math inline">\(\mu(x)\)</span> <strong>functional form</strong> assumptions because they restrict the class of functions that <span class="math inline">\(\mu(x)\)</span> can take. While powerful, these types of assumptions can muddy the roles of defining the quantity of interest and estimation. If our estimator <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\mu}(x)\)</span> performs poorly, it will be difficult to tell if this is because the estimator is flawed or our functional form assumptions are incorrect.</p>
<p>To help clarify these issues, we will pursue a different approach: understanding what linear regression can estimate under minimal assumptions and then investigating how well this estimand approximates the true CEF.</p>

<p>Let’s set aside the idea of the conditional expectation function and instead focus on finding the <strong>linear</strong> function of a single covariate <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span> that best predicts the outcome. Remember that linear functions have the form <span class="math inline">\(a + bX_i\)</span>. The <strong>best linear predictor</strong> (BLP) or <strong>population linear regression</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span> is defined as <span class="math display">\[
m(x) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x \quad\text{where, }\quad (\beta_{0}, \beta_{1}) = \argmin_{(b_{0}, b_{1}) \in \mathbb{R}^{2}}\; \E[(Y_{i} - b_{0} + b_{1}X_{i} )^{2}].
\]</span> That is, the best linear predictor is the line that results in the lowest mean-squared error predictions of the outcome given the covariates, averaging over the joint distribution of the data. This function is a feature of the joint distribution of the data—the DGP—and so represents something that we would like to learn about with our sample. It is an alternative to the CEF for summarizing the relationship between the outcome and the covariate, though we will see that they will sometimes be equal. We call <span class="math inline">\((\beta_{0}, \beta_{1})\)</span> the <strong>population linear regression coefficients</strong>. Notice that <span class="math inline">\(m(x)\)</span> could differ greatly from the CEF <span class="math inline">\(\mu(x)\)</span> if the latter is nonlinear.</p>
<p>We can solve for the best linear predictor using standard calculus (taking the derivative with respect to each coefficient, setting those equations equal to 0, and solving the system of equations). The first-order conditions, in this case, are <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
  \frac{\partial \E[(Y_{i} - b_{0} + b_{1}X_{i} )^{2}]}{\partial b_{0}} = \E[2(Y_{i} - \beta_{0} - \beta_{1}X_{i})] = 0 \\
  \frac{\partial \E[(Y_{i} - b_{0} + b_{1}X_{i} )^{2}]}{\partial b_{1}} = \E[2(Y_{i} - \beta_{0} - \beta_{1}X_{i})X_{i}] = 0
\end{aligned}  
\]</span> Given the linearity of expectations, it is easy to solve for <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span> in terms of <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[
\beta_{0} = \E[Y_{i}] - \beta_{1}\E[X_{i}].
\]</span> We can plug this into the first-order condition for <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> to get <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
  0 &amp;= \E[Y_{i}X_{i}] - (\E[Y_{i}] - \beta_{1}\E[X_{i}])\E[X_{i}] - \beta_{1}\E[X_{i}^{2}] \\
    &amp;= \E[Y_{i}X_{i}] - \E[Y_{i}]\E[X_{i}] - \beta_{1}(\E[X_{i}^{2}] - \E[X_{i}]^{2})  \\
    &amp;= \cov(X_{i},Y_{i}) - \beta_{1}\V[X_{i}]\\
  \beta_{1} &amp;= \frac{\cov(X_{i},Y_{i})}{\V[X_{i}]}
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>Thus the slope on the population linear regression of <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span> is equal to the ratio of the covariance of the two variables divided by the variance of <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span>. From this, we can immediately see that the covariance will determine the sign of the slope: positive covariances will lead to positive <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>, and negative covariances will lead to negative <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>. In addition, we can see if <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span> are independent, then <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1 = 0\)</span>. The slope scaled this covariance by the variance of the covariate, so slopes are lower for more spread-out covariates and higher for more spread-out covariates. If we define the correlation between these variables as <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{YX}\)</span>, then we can relate the coefficient to this quantity as <span class="math display">\[
\beta_1 = \rho_{YX}\sqrt{\frac{\V[Y_i]}{\V[X_i]}}.
\]</span></p>
<p>Collecting together our results, we can write the population linear regression as <span class="math display">\[
m(x) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x = \E[Y_i] + \beta_1(x - \E[X_i]),
\]</span> which shows how we adjust our best guess about <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> from the mean of the outcome using the covariate.</p>
<p>It’s important to remember that the BLP, <span class="math inline">\(m(x)\)</span>, and the CEF, <span class="math inline">\(\mu(x)\)</span>, are distinct entities. If the CEF is nonlinear, as in <a href="#fig-cef-blp">Figure&nbsp;<span>5.2</span></a>, there will be a difference between these functions, meaning that the BLP might produce subpar predictions. Below, we will derive a formal connection between the BLP and the CEF.</p>

<p>The linear part of the best linear predictor is less restrictive than at first glance. We can easily modify the minimum MSE problem to find the best quadratic, cubic, or general polynomial function of <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span> that predicts <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span>. For example, the quadratic function of <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span> that best predicts <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> would be <span class="math display">\[
m(X_i, X_i^2) = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_i \beta_2X_i^2 \quad\text{where}\quad \argmin_{(b_0,b_1,b_2) \in \mathbb{R}^3}\;\E[(Y_{i} - b_{0} - b_{1}X_{i} - b_{2}X_{i}^{2})^{2}].
\]</span> This equation is now a quadratic function of the covariates, but it is still a linear function of the unknown parameters <span class="math inline">\((\beta_{0}, \beta_{1}, \beta_{2})\)</span> so we will call this a best linear predictor.</p>
<p>We could include higher order terms of <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span> in the same manner, and as we include more polynomial terms, <span class="math inline">\(X_i^p\)</span>, the more flexible the function of <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span> we will capture with the BLP. When we estimate the BLP, however, we usually will pay for this flexibility in terms of overfitting and high variance in our estimates.</p>

<p>We now generalize the idea of a best linear predictor to a setting with an arbitrary number of covariates. In this setting, remember that the linear function will be</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\bfx'\bfbeta = x_{1}\beta_{1} + x_{2}\beta_{2} + \cdots + X_{k}\beta_{k}.

<p>This BLP solves the same fundamental optimization problem as in the bivariate case: it chooses the set of coefficients that minimizes the mean-squared error averaging over the joint distribution of the data.</p>

<p>Without some assumptions on the joint distribution of the data, The following “regularity conditions” will ensure the existence of the BLP:</p>

</div>
<p>Under these assumptions, it is possible to derive a closed-form expression for the <strong>population coefficients</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\bfbeta\)</span> using matrix calculus. To set up the optimization problem, we will find the first-order condition by taking the derivative of the expectation of the squared errors. First, let’s take the derivative of the squared prediction errors using the chain rule: <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
  \frac{\partial}{\partial \mb{b}^{'}}\left(Y_{i} - \X_{i}'\mb{b}\right)^{2}
  &amp;= 2\left(Y_{i} - \X_{i}'\mb{b}\right)\frac{\partial}{\partial \mb{b}'}(Y_{i} - \X_{i}'\mb{b})  \\
  &amp;= -2\left(Y_{i} - \X_{i}'\mb{b}\right)\X_{i} \\
  &amp;= -2\left(\X_{i}Y_{i} - \X_{i}\X_{i}'\mb{b}\right)
\end{aligned}
\]</span> We can now plug this into the expectation to get the first-order condition and solve for <span class="math inline">\(\bfbeta\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
  0 &amp;= -2\E[\X_{i}Y_{i} - \X_{i}\X_{i}'\bfbeta ]  \\
  \E[\X_{i}\X_{i}'] \bfbeta &amp;= \E[\X_{i}Y_{i}],

\]</span> which implies the population coefficients are <span class="math display">\[
\bfbeta = \left(\E[\X_{i}\X_{i}']\right)^{-1}\E[\X_{i}Y_{i}] = \mb{Q}_{\mb{XX}}^{-1}\mb{Q}_{\mb{X}Y}
\]</span> We now have an expression for the coefficients for the population best linear predictor in terms of the joint distribution <span class="math inline">\((Y_{i}, \X_{i})\)</span>. A couple of facts might be useful for reasoning this expression. Recall that <span class="math inline">\(\mb{Q}_{\mb{XX}} = \E[\X_{i}\X_{i}']\)</span> is a <span class="math inline">\(k\times k\)</span> matrix and <span class="math inline">\(\mb{Q}_{\X Y} = \E[\X_{i}Y_{i}]\)</span> is a <span class="math inline">\(k\times 1\)</span> column vector, which implies that <span class="math inline">\(\bfbeta\)</span> is also a <span class="math inline">\(k \times 1\)</span> column vector.</p>

<p>Intuitively, what is happening in the expression for the population regression coefficients? It is helpful to separate the intercept or constant term so that we have <span class="math display">\[
Y_{i} = \beta_{0} + \X'\bfbeta + e_{i},
\]</span> so <span class="math inline">\(\bfbeta\)</span> refers to just the vector of coefficients for the covariates. In this case, we can write the coefficients in a more interpretable way: <span class="math display">\[
\bfbeta = \V[\X]^{-1}\text{Cov}(\X, Y), \qquad \beta_0 = \mu_Y - \mb{\mu}'_{\mb{X}}\bfbeta
\]</span></p>
<p>Thus, the population coefficients take the covariance between the outcome and the covariates and “divide” it by information about variances and covariances of the covariates. The intercept recenters the regression so that projection errors are mean zero. Thus, we can see that these coefficients generalize the bivariate formula to this multiple covariate context.</p>

<p>With an expression for the population linear regression coefficients, we can write the linear projection as <span class="math display">\[
m(\X_{i}) = \X_{i}'\left(\E[\X_{i}\X_{i}']\right)^{-1}\E[\X_{i}Y_{i}] = \X_{i}'\mb{Q}_{\mb{XX}}^{-1}\mb{Q}_{\mb{X}Y}

<h3 data-number="5.2.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="projection-error"><span class="header-section-number">5.2.4</span> Projection error</h3>
<p>The <strong>projection error</strong> is the difference between the actual value of <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> and the projection, <span class="math display">\[
e_{i} = Y_{i} - m(\X_{i}) =  Y_i - \X_{i}'\bfbeta,
\]</span> where we have made no assumptions about this error yet. The projection error is simply the prediction error of the best linear prediction. Rewriting this definition, we can see that we can always write the outcome as the linear projection plus the projection error, <span class="math display">\[
Y_{i} = \X_{i}'\bfbeta + e_{i}.
\]</span> Notice that this looks suspiciously similar to a linearity assumption on the CEF, but we haven’t made any assumptions here. Instead, we have just used the definition of the projection error to write a tautological statement: <span class="math display">\[
Y_{i} = \X_{i}'\bfbeta + e_{i} = \X_{i}'\bfbeta + Y_{i} - \X_{i}'\bfbeta = Y_{i}.
\]</span> The critical difference between this representation and the usual linear model assumption is what properties <span class="math inline">\(e_{i}\)</span> possesses.</p>
<p>One key property of the projection errors is that when the covariate vector includes an “intercept” or constant term, the projection errors are uncorrelated with the covariates. To see this, we first note that <span class="math inline">\(\E[\X_{i}e_{i}] = 0\)</span> since <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
  \E[\X_{i}e_{i}] &amp;= \E[\X_{{i}}(Y_{i} - \X_{i}'\bfbeta)] \\
                  &amp;= \E[\X_{i}Y_{i}] - \E[\X_{i}\X_{i}']\bfbeta \\
                  &amp;= \E[\X_{i}Y_{i}] - \E[\X_{i}\X_{i}']\left(\E[\X_{i}\X_{i}']\right)^{-1}\E[\X_{i}Y_{i}] \\
  &amp;= \E[\X_{i}Y_{i}] - \E[\X_{i}Y_{i}] = 0
\end{aligned}
\]</span> Thus, for every <span class="math inline">\(X_{ij}\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\X_{i}\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(\E[X_{ij}e_{i}] =0\)</span>. If one of the entries in <span class="math inline">\(\X_i\)</span> is a constant 1, then this also implies that <span class="math inline">\(\E[e_{i}] =0\)</span>. Together, these facts imply that the projection error is uncorrelated with each <span class="math inline">\(X_{ij}\)</span>, since <span class="math display">\[
\cov(X_{ij}, e_{i}) = \E[X_{ij}e_{i}] - \E[X_{ij}]\E[e_{i}] = 0 - 0 = 0
\]</span> Notice that we still have made no assumptions about these projection errors except for some mild regularity conditions on the joint distribution of the outcome and covariates. Thus, in very general settings, we can write the linear projection model <span class="math inline">\(Y_i = \X_i'\bfbeta + e_i\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\bfbeta = \left(\E[\X_{i}\X_{i}']\right)^{-1}\E[\X_{i}Y_{i}]\)</span> and conclude that <span class="math inline">\(\E[\X_{i}e_{i}] = 0\)</span> by definition not by assumption.</p>
<p>The projection error is uncorrelated with the covariates, so does this mean that the CEF is linear? Unfortunately, no. Recall that while independence implies uncorrelated, the reverse does not hold. So when we look at the CEF, we have <span class="math display">\[
\E[Y_{i} \mid \X_{i}] = \X_{i}'\bfbeta + \E[e_{i} \mid \X_{i}],
\]</span> and the last term <span class="math inline">\(\E[e_{i} \mid \X_{i}]\)</span> would only be 0 if the errors were independent of the covariates, so <span class="math inline">\(\E[e_{i} \mid \X_{i}] = \E[e_{i}] = 0\)</span>. But nowhere in the linear projection model did we assume this. So while we can (almost) always write the outcome as <span class="math inline">\(Y_i = \X_i'\bfbeta + e_i\)</span> and have those projection errors be uncorrelated with the covariates, it will require additional assumptions to ensure that the true CEF is, in fact, linear <span class="math inline">\(\E[Y_{i} \mid \X_{i}] = \X_{i}'\bfbeta\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let’s take a step back. What have we shown here? In a nutshell, we have shown that a population linear regression exists under very general conditions, and we can write the coefficients of that population linear regression as a function of expectations of the joint distribution of the data. We did not assume that the CEF was linear nor that the projection errors were normal.</p>
<p>Why do we care about this? The ordinary least squares estimator, the workhorse regression estimator, targets this quantity of interest in large samples, regardless of whether the true CEF is linear or not. Thus, even when a linear CEF assumption is incorrect, OLS still targets a perfectly valid quantity of interest: the coefficients from this population linear projection.</p>

<p>What is the relationship between the best linear predictor (which we just saw generally exists) and the CEF? To draw the connection, remember a vital property of the conditional expectation: it is the function of <span class="math inline">\(\X_i\)</span> that best predicts <span class="math inline">\(Y_{i}\)</span>. The population regression was the best <strong>linear</strong> predictor, but the CEF is the best predictor among all nicely behaved functions of <span class="math inline">\(\X_{i}\)</span>, linear or nonlinear. In particular, if we label <span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span> be the set of all functions of the covariates <span class="math inline">\(g()\)</span> that have finite squared expectation, <span class="math inline">\(\E[g(\X_{i})^{2}] &lt; \infty\)</span>, then we can show that the CEF has the lowest squared prediction error in this class of functions: <span class="math display">\[
\mu(\X) = \E[Y_{i} \mid \X_{i}] = \argmin_{g(\X_i) \in L_2}\; \E\left[(Y_{i} - f(\X_{i}))^{2}\right],
\]</span></p>
<p>So we have established that the CEF is the best predictor and the population linear regression <span class="math inline">\(m(\X_{i})\)</span> is the best linear predictor. These two facts allow us to connect the CEF and the population regression.</p>
<div id="thm-cef-blp" class="theorem">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Theorem 5.1 </strong></span>If <span class="math inline">\(\mu(\X_{i})\)</span> is a linear function of <span class="math inline">\(\X_i\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(\mu(\X_{i}) = m(\X_{i}) = \X_i'\bfbeta\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>This theorem says that if the true CEF is linear, it equals the population linear regression. The proof of this is straightforward: the CEF is the best predictor, so if it is linear, it must also be the best linear predictor.</p>
<p>In general, we are in the business of learning about the CEF, so we are unlikely to know if it genuinely is linear or not. In some situations, however, we can show that the CEF is linear without any additional assumptions. These will be situations when the covariates take on a finite number of possible values. Suppose we are interested in the CEF of poll wait times for Black (<span class="math inline">\(X_i = 1\)</span>) vs.&nbsp;non-Black (<span class="math inline">\(X_i = 0\)</span>) voters. In this case, there are two possible values of the CEF, <span class="math inline">\(\mu(1) = \E[Y_{i}\mid X_{i}= 1]\)</span>, the average wait time for Black voters, and <span class="math inline">\(\mu(0) = \E[Y_{i}\mid X_{i} = 0]\)</span>, the average wait time for non-Black voters. Notice that we can write the CEF as <span class="math display">\[
\mu(x) = x \mu(1) + (1 - x) \mu(0) = \mu(0) + x\left(\mu(1) - \mu(0)\right)= \beta_0 + x\beta_1,
\]</span> which is clearly a linear function of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. Based on this derivation, we can see that the coefficients of this linear CEF have a clear interpretation:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\beta_0 = \mu(0)\)</span>: the expected wait time for a Black voter.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\beta_1 = \mu(1) - \mu(0)\)</span>: the difference in average wait times between Black and non-Black voters. Notice that it matters how <span class="math inline">\(X_{i}\)</span> is defined here since the intercept will always be the average outcome when <span class="math inline">\(X_i = 0\)</span>, and the slope will always be the difference in means between the <span class="math inline">\(X_i = 1\)</span> group and the <span class="math inline">\(X_i = 0\)</span> group.</li>
</ul>
<p>What about a categorical covariate with more than two levels? For instance, we might be interested in wait times by party identification, where <span class="math inline">\(X_i = 1\)</span> indicates Democratic voters, <span class="math inline">\(X_i = 2\)</span> indicates Republican voters, and <span class="math inline">\(X_i = 3\)</span> indicates independent voters. How can we write the CEF of wait times as a linear function of this variable? That would assume that the difference between Democrats and Republicans is the same as for Independents and Republicans. With more than two levels, we can represent a categorical variable as a vector of binary variables, <span class="math inline">\(\X_i = (X_{i1}, X_{i2})\)</span>, where <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
  X_{{i1}} &amp;= \begin{cases}
                1&amp;\text{if Republican} \\
                   0 &amp; \text{if not Republican}
              \end{cases} \\
X_{{i2}} &amp;= \begin{cases}
                1&amp;\text{if independent} \\
                   0 &amp; \text{if not independent}
              \end{cases} \\
\end{aligned}
\]</span> These two indicator variables encode the same information as the original three-level variable, <span class="math inline">\(X_{i}\)</span>. If I know the values of <span class="math inline">\(X_{i1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X_{i2}\)</span>, I know exactly what party to which <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> belongs. Thus, the CEFs for <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span> and the pair of indicator variables, <span class="math inline">\(\X_i\)</span>, are precisely the same, but the latter admits a lovely linear representation, <span class="math display">\[
\E[Y_i \mid X_{i1}, X_{i2}] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{i1} + \beta_2 X_{i2},
\]</span> where</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\beta_0 = \E[Y_{i} \mid X_{i1} = 0, X_{i2} = 0]\)</span> is the average wait time for the group who does not get an indicator variable (Democrats in this case).</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\beta_1 = \E[Y_{i} \mid X_{i1} = 1, X_{i2} = 0] - \E[Y_{i} \mid X_{i1} = 0, X_{i2} = 0]\)</span> is the difference in means between Republican voters and Democratic voters, or the difference between the first indicator group and the baseline group.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\beta_2 = \E[Y_{i} \mid X_{i1} = 0, X_{i2} = 1] - \E[Y_{i} \mid X_{i1} = 0, X_{i2} = 0]\)</span> is the difference in means between independent voters and Democratic voters, or the difference between the second indicator group and the baseline group.</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach easily generalizes to categorical variables with an arbitrary number of levels.</p>
<p>What have we shown? The CEF will be linear without additional assumptions when there is a categorical covariate. We can show that this continues to hold even when we have multiple categorical variables. We now have two binary covariates: <span class="math inline">\(X_{i1}=1\)</span> indicating a Black voter, and <span class="math inline">\(X_{i2} = 1\)</span> indicating an urban voter. With these two binary variables, there are four possible values of the CEF: <span class="math display">\[
\mu(x_1, x_2) = \begin{cases}
\mu_{00} &amp; \text{if } x_1 = 0 \text{ and } x_2 = 0 \text{ (non-Black, rural)} \\
  \mu_{10} &amp; \text{if }  x_1 = 1 \text{ and } x_2 = 0 \text{ (Black, rural)}\\
  \mu_{01} &amp; \text{if }  x_1 = 0 \text{ and } x_2 = 1 \text{ (non-Black, urban)}\\
\mu_{11} &amp; \text{if }  x_1 = 1 \text{ and } x_2 = 1 \text{ (Black, urban)}
\end{cases}
\]</span> We can write this as <span class="math display">\[
\mu(x_{1}, x_{2}) = (1 - x_{1})(1 - x_{2})\mu_{00} + x_{1}(1 -x_{2})\mu_{10} + (1-x_{1})x_{2}\mu_{01} + x_{1}x_{2}\mu_{11},
\]</span> which we can rewrite as <span class="math display">\[
\mu(x_1, x_2) = \beta_0 + x_1\beta_1 + x_2\beta_2 + x_1x_2\beta_3,
\]</span> where</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\beta_0 = \mu_{00}\)</span>: average wait times for rural non-Black voters.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\beta_1 = \mu_{10} - \mu_{00}\)</span>: difference in means for rural Black vs.&nbsp;rural non-Black voters.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\beta_2 = \mu_{01} - \mu_{00}\)</span>: difference in means for urban non-Black vs.&nbsp;rural non-Black voters.</li>

</ul>
<p>Thus, we can write the CEF with two binary covariates as linear when the linear specification includes and multiplicative interaction between them (<span class="math inline">\(x_1x_2\)</span>). This result holds for all pairs of binary covariates, and we can generalize the interpretation of the coefficients in the CEF as</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\beta_0 = \mu_{00}\)</span>: average outcome when both variables are 0.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\beta_1 = \mu_{10} - \mu_{00}\)</span>: difference in average outcomes for the first covariate when the second covariate is 0.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\beta_2 = \mu_{01} - \mu_{00}\)</span>: difference in average outcomes for the second covariate when the first covariate is 0.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\beta_3 = (\mu_{11} - \mu_{01}) - (\mu_{10} - \mu_{00})\)</span>: change in the “effect” of the first (second) covariate when the second (first) covariate goes from 0 to 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>This result also generalizes to an arbitrary number of binary covariates. If we have <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> binary covariates, then the CEF will be linear with all two-way interactions, <span class="math inline">\(x_1x_2\)</span>, all three-way interactions, <span class="math inline">\(x_1x_2x_3\)</span>, up to the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-way interaction <span class="math inline">\(x_1\times\cdots\times x_p\)</span>. Furthermore, we can generalize to arbitrary numbers of categorical variables by expanding each into a series of binary variables and then including all interactions between the resulting binary variables.</p>
<p>We have established that when we have a set of categorical covariates, the true CEF will be linear, and we have seen the various ways to represent that CEF. Notice that when we use, for example, ordinary least squares, we are free to choose how to include our variables. That means that we could run a regression of <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(X_{i1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X_{i2}\)</span> without an interaction term. This model will only be correct if <span class="math inline">\(\beta_3\)</span> is equal to 0, and so the interaction term is irrelevant. Because of this ability to choose our models, it’s helpful to have a language for models that capture the linear CEF appropriately. We call a model <strong>saturated</strong> if there are as many coefficients as the CEF’s unique values. A saturated model, by its nature, can always be written as a linear function without assumptions. The above examples show how to construct saturated models in various situations.</p>

<p>We have seen how to interpret population regression coefficients when the CEF is linear without assumptions. How do we interpret the population coefficients <span class="math inline">\(\bfbeta\)</span> in other settings?</p>
<p>Let’s start with the simplest case, where every entry in <span class="math inline">\(\X_{i}\)</span> represents a different covariate, and no covariate is any function of another (we’ll see why this caveat is necessary below). In this simple case, the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>th coefficient, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_{k}\)</span> will represent the change in the predicted outcome for a one-unit change in the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>th covariate <span class="math inline">\(X_{ik}\)</span>, holding all other covariates fixed. We can see this from <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
  m(x_{1} + 1, x_{2}) &amp; =  \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}(x_{1} + 1) + \beta_{2}x_{2} \\
  m(x_{1}, x_{2}) &amp;= \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{1} + \beta_{2}x_{2},
\end{aligned}
\]</span> so that the change in the predicted outcome for increasing <span class="math inline">\(X_{i1}\)</span> by one unit isn’t <span class="math display">\[
m(x_{1} + 1, x_{2}) -  m(x_{1}, x_{2}) = \beta_1
\]</span> Notice that nothing changes in this interpretation if we add more covariates to the vector, <span class="math display">\[
m(x_{1} + 1, \bfx_{2}) -  m(x_{1}, \bfx_{2}) = \beta_1,
\]</span> the coefficient on a particular variable is the change in the predicted outcome for a one-unit change in the covariate holding all other covariates constant. Each coefficient summarizes the “all else equal” difference in the predicted outcome for each covariate.</p>
<section id="polynomial-functions-of-the-covariates" class="level3" data-number="5.4.1">
<h3 data-number="5.4.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="polynomial-functions-of-the-covariates"><span class="header-section-number">5.4.1</span> Polynomial functions of the covariates</h3>
<p>The interpretation of the population regression coefficients becomes more complicated when we include nonlinear functions of the covariates. In that case, multiple coefficients control how a change in a covariate will change the predicted value of <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span>. Suppose that we have a quadratic function of <span class="math inline">\(X_{i1}\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[
m(x_1, x_1^2, x_{2}) = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{1} + \beta_{2}x_{1}^{2} + \beta_{3}x_{2},
\]</span> and try to look at a one-unit change in <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
  m(x_{1} + 1, (x_{1} + 1)^{2}, x_{2}) &amp; =  \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}(x_{1} + 1) +  \beta_{2}(x_{1} + 1)^{2}+ \beta_{3}x_{2} \\
  m(x_{1}, x_{1}^{2}, x_{2}) &amp;= \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{1} +  \beta_{2}x_{1}^{2} + \beta_{3}x_{2},
\end{aligned}
\]</span> resulting in <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1 + \beta_2(2x_{1} + 1)\)</span>. This formula might be an interesting quantity, but we will more commonly use the derivative of <span class="math inline">\(m(\bfx)\)</span> with respect to <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> as a measure of the marginal effect of <span class="math inline">\(X_{i1}\)</span> on the predicted value of <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> (holding all other variables constant), where “marginal” here means the change in prediction for a very small change in <span class="math inline">\(X_{i1}\)</span>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> In the case of the quadratic covariate, we have <span class="math display">\[
\frac{\partial m(x_{1}, x_{1}^{2}, x_{2})}{\partial x_{1}} = \beta_{1} + 2\beta_{2}x_{1}
\]</span> so the marginal effect on prediction varies as a function of <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span>. From this, we can see that the individual interpretations of the coefficients are less interesting: <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> is the marginal effect when <span class="math inline">\(X_{i1} = 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta_2 / 2\)</span> describes how a one-unit change in <span class="math inline">\(X_{i1}\)</span> changes the marginal effect. As is hopefully clear, it will often be more straightforward to visualize the nonlinear predictor function (perhaps using the orthogonalization techniques in <a href="#sec-fwl"><span>Section&nbsp;5.5</span></a>).</p>

<h3 data-number="5.4.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="interactions"><span class="header-section-number">5.4.2</span> Interactions</h3>
<p>Another common nonlinear function of the covariates is when we include <strong>interaction terms</strong> or covariates that are products of two other covariates, <span class="math display">\[
m(x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{1}x_{2}) = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{1} + \beta_{2}x_{2} + \beta_{3}x_{1}x_{2}.
\]</span> In these situations, we can also use the derivative of the BLP to measure the marginal effect of one variable or the other on the predicted value of <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span>. In particular, we have <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
  \frac{\partial m(x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{1}x_{2})}{\partial x_1} &amp;= \beta_1 + \beta_3x_2, \\
  \frac{\partial m(x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{1}x_{2})}{\partial x_2} &amp;= \beta_2 + \beta_3x_2.
\end{aligned}
\]</span> Here, the coefficients are slightly more interpretable:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>: the marginal effect of <span class="math inline">\(X_{i1}\)</span> on predicted <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(X_{i2} = 0\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\beta_2\)</span>: the marginal effect of <span class="math inline">\(X_{i2}\)</span> on predicted <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(X_{i1} = 0\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\beta_3\)</span>: the change in the marginal effect of <span class="math inline">\(X_{i1}\)</span> due to a one-unit change in <span class="math inline">\(X_{i2}\)</span> <strong>OR</strong> the change in the marginal effect of <span class="math inline">\(X_{i2}\)</span> due to a one-unit change in <span class="math inline">\(X_{i2}\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we add more covariates to this BLP, these interpretations change to “holding all other covariates constant.”</p>
<p>Interactions are a routine part of social science research because they allow us to assess how the relationship between the outcome and an independent variable varies by the values of another variable. In the context of our study of voter wait times, if <span class="math inline">\(X_{i1}\)</span> is income and <span class="math inline">\(X_{i2}\)</span> is the Black/non-Black voter indicator, then <span class="math inline">\(\beta_3\)</span> represents how the change in slope of the wait time-income relationship between Black and non-Black voters.</p>

<h2 data-number="5.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-fwl"><span class="header-section-number">5.5</span> Multiple regression from bivariate regression</h2>
<p>When we have a regression of an outcome on two covariates, it is helpful to understand how the coefficients of one variable relate to the other. For example, if we have the following best linear projection: <span id="eq-two-var-blp"><span class="math display">\[
(\alpha, \beta, \gamma) = \argmin_{(a,b,c) \in \mathbb{R}^{3}} \; \E[(Y_{i} - (a + bX_{i} + cZ_{i}))^{2}]
\tag{5.1}\]</span></span> Is there some way to understand the <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> coefficient here regarding simple linear regression? As it turns out, yes. From the above results, we know that the intercept has a simple form: <span class="math display">\[
\alpha = \E[Y_i] - \beta\E[X_i] - \gamma\E[Z_i].
\]</span> Let’s investigate the first order condition for <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
  0 &amp;= \E[Y_{i}X_{i}] - \alpha\E[X_{i}] - \beta\E[X_{i}^{2}] - \gamma\E[X_{i}Z_{i}] \\
    &amp;=  \E[Y_{i}X_{i}] - \E[Y_{i}]\E[X_{i}] + \beta\E[X_{i}]^{2} + \gamma\E[X_{i}]\E[Z_{i}] - \beta\E[X_{i}^{2}] - \gamma\E[X_{i}Z_{i}] \\
  &amp;= \cov(Y, X) - \beta\V[X_{i}] - \gamma \cov(X_{i}, Z_{i})
\end{aligned}
\]</span> We can see from this that if <span class="math inline">\(\cov(X_{i}, Z_{i}) = 0\)</span>, then the coefficient on <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span> will be the same as in the simple regression case, <span class="math inline">\(\cov(Y_{i}, X_{i})/\V[X_{i}]\)</span>. When <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Z_i\)</span> are uncorrelated, we sometimes call them <strong>orthogonal</strong>.</p>
<p>To write a simple formula for <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> when the covariates are not orthogonal, we will <strong>orthogonalize</strong> <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span> by obtaining the prediction errors from a population linear regression of <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(Z_i\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[
\widetilde{X}_{i} = X_{i} - (\delta_{0} + \delta_{1}Z_{i}) \quad\text{where}\quad (\delta_{0}, \delta_{1}) = \argmin_{(d_{0},d_{1}) \in \mathbb{R}^{2}} \; \E[(X_{i} - (d_{0}  + d_{1}Z_{i}))^{2}]
\]</span> Given the properties of projection errors, we know that this orthogonalized version of <span class="math inline">\(X_{i}\)</span> will be uncorrelated with <span class="math inline">\(Z_{i}\)</span> since <span class="math inline">\(\E[\widetilde{X}_{i}Z_{i}] = 0\)</span>. Remarkably, the coefficient on <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span> from the “long” BLP in <a href="#eq-two-var-blp">Equation&nbsp;<span>5.1</span></a> is the same as the regression of <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> on this orthogonalized <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde{X}_i\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[
\beta = \frac{\text{cov}(Y_{i}, \widetilde{X}_{i})}{\V[\widetilde{X}_{i}]}
\]</span></p>
<p>We can expand this idea to when there are several other covariates. Suppose now that we are interested in a regression of <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(\X_i\)</span> and we are interested in the coefficient on the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>th covariate. Let <span class="math inline">\(\X_{i,-k}\)</span> be the vector of covariates omitting the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>th entry and let <span class="math inline">\(m_k(\X_{i,-k})\)</span> represent the BLP of <span class="math inline">\(X_{ik}\)</span> on these other covariates. We can define <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde{X}_{ik} = X_{ik} - m_{k}(\X_{i,-k})\)</span> as the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>th variable orthogonalized with respect to the rest of the variables and we can write the coefficient on <span class="math inline">\(X_{ik}\)</span> as <span class="math display">\[
\beta_k = \frac{\cov(Y_i, \widetilde{X}_{ik})}{\V[\widetilde{X}_{ik}]}.
\]</span> Thus, the population regression coefficient in the BLP is the same as from a bivariate regression of the outcome on the projection error for <span class="math inline">\(X_{ik}\)</span> projected on all other covariates. One interpretation of coefficients in a population multiple regression is they represent the relationship between the outcome and the covariate after removing the linear relationships of all other variables.</p>

<h2 data-number="5.6" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="omitted-variable-bias"><span class="header-section-number">5.6</span> Omitted variable bias</h2>
<p>In many situations, we might need to choose to include a variable in a regression or not, so it can be helpful to understand how this choice might affect the population coefficients on the other variables in the regression. Suppose we have a variable <span class="math inline">\(Z_i\)</span> that we may add to our regression which currently has <span class="math inline">\(\X_i\)</span> as the covariates. We can write this new projection as <span class="math display">\[
m(\X_i, Z_i) = \X_i'\bfbeta + Z_i\gamma, \qquad m(\X_{i}) = \X_i'\bs{\delta},
\]</span> where we often refer to <span class="math inline">\(m(\X_i, Z_i)\)</span> as the long regression and <span class="math inline">\(m(\X_i)\)</span> as the short regression.</p>
<p>We know from the definition of the BLP that we can write the short coefficients as <span class="math display">\[
\bs{\delta} = \left(\E[\X_{i}\X_{i}']\right)^{-1} \E[\X_{i}Y_{i}].
\]</span> Letting <span class="math inline">\(e_i = Y_i - m(\X_{i}, Z_{i})\)</span> be the projection errors from the long regression, we can write this as <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
  \bs{\delta} &amp;= \left(\E[\X_{i}\X_{i}']\right)^{-1} \E[\X_{i}(\X_{i}'\bfbeta + Z_{i}\gamma + e_{i})] \\
              &amp;= \left(\E[\X_{i}\X_{i}']\right)^{-1}(\E[\X_{i}\X_{i}']\bfbeta + \E[\X_{i}Z_{i}]\gamma + \E[\X_{i}e_{i}]) \\
  &amp;=    \bfbeta + \left(\E[\X_{i}\X_{i}']\right)^{-1}\E[\X_{i}Z_{i}]\gamma
\end{aligned}
\]</span> Notice that the vector in the second term is the linear projection coefficients of a population linear regression of <span class="math inline">\(Z_i\)</span> on the <span class="math inline">\(\X_i\)</span>. If we call these coefficients <span class="math inline">\(\bs{\pi}\)</span>, then the short coefficients are <span class="math display">\[
\bs{\delta} = \bfbeta + \bs{\pi}\gamma.
\]</span></p>
<p>We can rewrite this to show that the difference between the coefficients in these two projections is <span class="math inline">\(\bs{\delta} - \bfbeta= \bs{\pi}\gamma\)</span> or the product of the coefficient on the “excluded” <span class="math inline">\(Z_i\)</span> and the coefficient of the included <span class="math inline">\(\X_i\)</span> on the excluded. Most textbooks refer to this difference as the <strong>omitted variable bias</strong> of omitting <span class="math inline">\(Z_i\)</span> under the idea that <span class="math inline">\(\bfbeta\)</span> is the true target of inference. But the result is much broader than this since it just tells us how to relate the coefficients of two nested projections.</p>
<p>The last two results (multiple regressions from bivariate and omitted variable bias) are sometimes presented as results for the ordinary least squares estimator that we will show in the next chapter. We introduce them here as features of a particular population quantity, the linear projection or population linear regression.</p>

<p>The best linear predictor is, of course, a <em>linear</em> approximation to the CEF, and this approximation could be quite poor if the true CEF is highly nonlinear. A more subtle issue with the BLP is that it is sensitive to the marginal distribution of the covariates when the CEF is nonlinear. Let’s return to our example of voter wait times and income. In <a href="#fig-blp-limits">Figure&nbsp;<span>5.3</span></a>, we show the true CEF and the BLP when we restrict income below $50,000 or above $100,000. The BLP can vary quite dramatically here.
